Hello, I created a program in python that will allow you to control music played in the background of the system. I was directed to create it because I bought a new 65% keyboard that has no multimedia buttons, which did not allow me to control the music. Of course, the program will be improved and updated over time. Enjoy the music :D  



KEYBOARDOLOGY:

ctrl + alt + p 	 	music controller play pause music
ctrl + alt + up	 	music controller increase volume
ctrl + alt + down	 	music controller decrease volume
ctrl + alt + right	 	music controller increase volume step
ctrl + alt + left	 	music controller decrease volume step
ctrl + alt + m 		music controller mute & unmute
ctrl + alt + shift + right	 music controller next track
ctrl + alt + shift + left	 music controller previous track
