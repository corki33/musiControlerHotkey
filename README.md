# musiControlerHotkey
Hello, I created a program in python that will allow you to control music played in the background of the system. I was directed to create it because I bought a new 65% keyboard that has no multimedia buttons, which did not allow me to control the music. Of course, the program will be improved and updated over time. Enjoy the music :D
